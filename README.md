## Front-end coding challange

## Finished project description

This project is a single page Angular based app with boostrap framework for styling. In each component style file there are also small styling corrections for the corresponding components.

Additionally there is a "styles" folder in "src/app/styles" where you can find the defined styles for the components that share the same styles eg.: Login and SignUp page uses the same style file "login-signup.scss"

As for unit testing, you can find the specs files in the "src/app/login","src/app/signup","src/app/articles" folders where I am testing the main features of the app, whether the forms are filled out correctly, http requests ( GET,PUT)

The app uses all the features described in the "README.md" file,namely

- Authentication
- Form validation (front-end, back-end)
- User Login
- User Registration
- Show your user profile
- Edit your user profile
- List/Delete User (not yourself)
- List/Create/Update/Delete Articles
